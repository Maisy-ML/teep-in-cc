              draft-yang-teep-usecase-for-cc-in-network-01

Abstract

Confidential computing is the protection of data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment. Confidential computing could provide integrity and confidentiality for users who want to run applications and process data in that environment. When confidential computing is used in scenarios which need network to provision users' data and applications in the TEE environmentï¼ŒTEEP architecture[I-D.ietf-teep-architecture] and protocol[] could be used. This document focuses on using TEEP to provision network users' data and applications in confidential computing. This document is a use case and extension of TEEP and could provide guidance for cloud computing, MEC[] and other scenarios to use confidential computing in network.

1.  Introduction

The Confidential Computing Consortium defined the concept of confidential computing as the protection of data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment"[CCC-White-Paper]. In detail, computing unit with confidential computing feature could generate an isolated hardware-protected area, in which data and applications will be protected from illegal access or tampering. When using network to provision confidential computing environment, users need to attest and deploy their data and applications in the TEE environment inside confidential computing device. 

The TEEP architecture defined the design and standardization of a protocol for managing the lifecycle of trusted applications running inside a TEE.  In confidential computing, the TEE can also be provisioned and managed by TEEP protocol.

This document illustrates how a network user uses the TEEP protocol to provision its private data and applications in confidential computing device. The intended audiences for this use case are network users and operators who are interested in using confidential computing in network.

    Figure 1: notional architecture of confidential computing in network

   *  Network user: Network user possesses personalization data and application that need to be deployed on confidential computing device. For example in MEC, the autonomous vehicles could deploy private application and data on confidential computing device to calculate on-vehicle and destination road information without knowing by MEC platform.

   *  Network Management/Orchestration Center: MO/C exists in the management and orchestration layer of network.  Network user uses the M/OC to request for computing resource.  The TAM is inside the M/OC to provide management function to TEEP agent via TEEP broker.

   *  Confidential Computing Device: Confidential Computing Device is connected by the network and can provide computing service to network user.

   *  Package: Package is a unit that is signed or encrypted by Data Owner and could be deployed on TEE/REE or treated as application data.  TA (Trusted Application) in confidential computing could be an application, or packaged with other components like library, TEE shim or even Guest OS. The specific package of confidential computing could refers to the white paper of common terminology of CCC(reference needed).

The connection between network user and M/OC depends on the implementation of specific network. The connection between network user and UA (Untrusted Application) or TA depends on the implementation of application. The connection between TAM, TEEP Broker and TEEP Agent refers to the TEEP protocol[I-D.ietf-teep-protocol].

4.  Usecases

The basic process of how a network user utilizes confidential computing is shown below.  In confidential computing, the bundle of an UA, TA, and PD (Personalization Data) refers to case 1,2,3,4 of TEEP architecture section 4.4.  Case 5 and 6 are new cases that possible in implementation.  At present, the main instances types exist in industry of confidential computing are confidential process,confidential container and confidential VM.

4.1.  UA, TA and PD are bundled as one package

This use case refers to the case 1 of TEEP architecture.  If the network user provides this package, the process of TEEP is as follow. Whenever PD is involved in a package, this package must be encrypted, similarly hereinafter.

   1.  Network user requests for confidential computing resource to the network M/OC.

   2.  M/OC orchestrates confidential computing device to undertake the request.

   3.  TAM requests remote attestation to the TEEP Agent, TEEP Agent then sends the evidence to TAM.  The TAM works as relying party in RATs architecture[].

   4.  After verification, the network user transfers the package to TAM and let TAM to transfer the package to TEEP Agent.

   5.  Network user establishes secure channel with TEEP agent, and transfers decryption key to TEEP Agent.
   
   6.  TEEP Agent deploys TA and personalization data, then deploy UA in REE via TEEP Broker.

   As for inform network users to develop their applications and data, the mapping of UA, TA and implementations are shown in figure 2.  This document gathers the main hardware architectures that support confidential computing, which include TrustZone[ref], SGX[ref], SEV-SNP[ref], CCA[ref] and TDX[ref]. The brace means the operation steps to deploy packages. The arrow means deploy package to a destination.

4.2.  PD is a separate package, TA and UA are separate or integrated

   This usecase refers to the case 2 and case 3 of TEEP architecture.
   The PD is a separate package, the UA and TA could be separated or
   integrated as a package.  If the network user provides packages like
   this, the process of TEEP is as follow.

   1.  Network user requests for confidential computing resource to the network M/OC.

   2.  M/OC orchestrates confidential computing device to undertake the request.

   3.  Network user transfers UA and TA to confidential computing device via TAM.  TAM then deploys these two applications in REE and TEE respectively.  (In SGX, UA must be deployed first, then let the UA to load TA in SGX.)

   4.  TAM requests remote attestation to the TEEP Agent, TEEP Agent then sends the evidence to TAM.  The TAM works as the relying party in RATs architecture.

   5.  Network user establishes secure channel with TA, and deploys personalization data to the TA.

   The mapping of UA, TA and implementations are shown in figure 3.

4.3.  TA and PD are bundled as a package, and UA is a separate package

   In this case, the process of TEEP is as follow.

   1.  Network user requests for confidential computing resource to the
       network M/OC.

   2.  TAM in M/OC orchestrates confidential computing device to
       undertake the request.

   3.  Network user deploys UA in REE.

   4.  TAM requests remote attestation to the TEEP Agent, TEEP Agent
       then response the evidence to TAM.  The TAM works as the relying
       party and forward the attestation result to network user.

   5.  Network user transfers encrypted TA and PD to TAM.  Then TAM
       transfers this package to TEEP Agent.  Network user creates
       secure channel with TEEP agent (via TAM) and transfers the
       decryption key to TEEP agent.

   6.  TEEP agent decrypts this package and deploys TA and PD.

Appendix A.  Submodules in TEEP Agent

   The original design of TEEP only includes TEEP Agent and TA inside
   TEE.  While in confidential computing implementation, other
   submodules may also be involved in the TEE.  In TEEP, these
   submodules could be covered by TEEP Agent.

   In SGX based confidential computing, submodule could provide
   convenient environment or API in which TA does not have to modify its
   source code to fit into SGX instructions.  Submodules like Gramine
   and Occlum .etc are examples that could be included in TEEP agent.
   If there is no submodule in TEEP agent, the TA and UA need to be
   customized applications which fit into the SGX architecture.

   In SEV and other architectures that support whole guest VM as a TEE,
   TEEP agent doesn't have to use extra submodule to work as a
   middleware or API.  However with some submodules like Enarx which
   works as a runtime JIT compiler, TA could be deployed in a hardware
   independent way.  In this scenario, TA could be deployed in different
   hardware architecture without re-compiling.
