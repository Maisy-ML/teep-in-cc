    <abstract>
      <t>Confidential computing is the protection of data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment. Confidential computing could provide integrity and confidentiality for users who want to run application and process data in that environment. When confidential computing is used in network like MEC and CAN which provide computing resource to network users, TEEP protocol could be used to provision network user&apos;s data and application in TEE environment in confidential computing resource. This document focuses on using TEEP to provision network user&apos;s data and application in confidential computing in such network. This document is a use case and extension of TEEP and could provide guidance for MEC, CAN and other scenarios to use confidential computing.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The Confidential Computing Consortium defined the concept of confidential computing as the protection of data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment" <xref target="CCC-White-Paper"></xref>. In detail, CPU with confidential computing feature could generate an isolated hardware-protected area, in which data and applications will be protected from illegal access or tampering.</t>
			<t>In the scenario of confidential computing in network, network users will attest the TEE in confidential computing and provision private data and applications to that TEE by network. This network could be a MEC<xref target="MEC"></xref>, CAN or other network that provide computing resource to users.</t>
			<t>TEEP architecture <xref target="I-D.ietf-teep-architecture"></xref> defined the design and standardization of a protocol for managing the lifecycle of trusted applications running inside a TEE. In confidential computing, this TEE can also be provisioned and managed by TEEP protocol.</t>
			<t>This document illustrates how a network user uses the TEEP protocol to provision its private data in confidential computing resource. The intended audiences for this use case are network users and operators who are interested in using confidential computing in network.</t>

		<section title="Submodules in TEEP Agent">
			<t>The original design of TEEP only includes TEEP Agent and TA inside TEE. While in confidential computing implementation, other submodules may also be involved in the TEE. In TEEP, these submodules could be covered by TEEP Agent.</t>
			<t>In SGX based confidential computing, submodule could provide convenient environment or API in which TA does not have to modify its source code to fit into SGX instructions. Submodules like Gramine and Occlum .etc are examples that could be included in TEEP agent. If there is no submodule in TEEP agent, the TA and UA need to be customized applications which fit into the SGX architecture.</t>
			<t>In SEV and other architectures that support whole guest VM as a TEE, TEEP agent doesn&apos;t have to use extra submodule to work as a middleware or API. However with some submodules like Enarx which works as a runtime JIT compiler, TA could be deployed in a hardware independent way. In this scenario, TA could be deployed in different hardware architecture without re-compiling.</t>
